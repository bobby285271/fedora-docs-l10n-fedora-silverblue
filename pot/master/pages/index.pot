"{variant-name} is a variant of Fedora Workstation.  It looks, feels and "

"However, unlike other operating systems, {variant-name} is immutable.  This "
"means that every installation is identical to every other installation of "
"the same version.  The operating system that is on disk is exactly the same "
"from one machine to the next, and it never changes as it is used."

"{variant-name}'s immutable design is intended to make it more stable, less "
"prone to bugs, and easier to test and develop.  Finally, {variant-name}'s "
"immutable design also makes it an excellent platform for containerized "
"applications as well as container-based software development.  In each case, "
"applications (apps) and containers are kept separate from the host system, "
"improving stability and reliability."

"{variant-name}'s core technologies have some other helpful features.  OS "
"updates are fast and there's no waiting around for them to install: just "
"reboot as normal to start using the next version.  With {variant-name}, it "
"is also possible to roll back to the previous version of the operating "
"system, if something goes wrong."
