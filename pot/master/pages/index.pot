"Silverblue is a variant of Fedora Workstation. It looks, feels and behaves "

"However, unlike other operating systems, Silverblue is immutable. This means "
"that every installation is identical to every other installation of the same "
"version. The operating system that is on disk is exactly the same from one "
"machine to the next, and it never changes as it is used."

"Silverblue's immutable design is intended to make it more stable, less prone "
"to bugs, and easier to test and develop. Finally, Silverblue's immutable "
"design also makes it an excellent platform for containerized applications as "
"well as container-based software development. In each case, applications "
"(apps) and containers are kept separate from the host system, improving "
"stability and reliability."

"Silverblue's core technologies have some other helpful features. OS updates "
"are fast and there's no waiting around for them to install: just reboot as "
"normal to start using the next version. With Silverblue, it is also possible "
"to roll back to the previous version of the operating system, if something "
"goes wrong."
