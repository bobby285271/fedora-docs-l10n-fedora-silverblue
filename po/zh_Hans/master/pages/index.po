"{variant-name} is a variant of Fedora Workstation.  It looks, feels and "
"behaves like a regular desktop operating system, and the experience is "
"similar to what you find with using a standard Fedora Workstation."

"However, unlike other operating systems, {variant-name} is immutable.  This "
"means that every installation is identical to every other installation of "
"the same version.  The operating system that is on disk is exactly the same "
"from one machine to the next, and it never changes as it is used."

"然而和其它操作系统不同的是，{variant-name} 是不可变的。这意味着同一版本下每一"

"{variant-name}'s immutable design is intended to make it more stable, less "
"prone to bugs, and easier to test and develop.  Finally, {variant-name}'s "
"immutable design also makes it an excellent platform for containerized "
"applications as well as container-based software development.  In each case, "
"applications (apps) and containers are kept separate from the host system, "
"improving stability and reliability."
msgstr ""
"{variant-name} 的不可变设计使得它更加稳定，更不容易出现错误，更易于测试和开"
"发。{variant-name} 的不可变设计也使其与容器化应用程序、容器应用开发成为绝配。"
"应用程序和容器与主机系统的分隔也使得系统更加可靠。"

"{variant-name}'s core technologies have some other helpful features.  OS "
"updates are fast and there's no waiting around for them to install: just "

"is also possible to roll back to the previous version of the operating "
"system, if something goes wrong."

"{variant-name} 使用的核心技术也带来了其它的特性。系统更新从此变得方便快捷：只"
