"Daily use of Fedora Silverblue as an acceptable workstation is not so easy "
"as its wonderfully seamless installation process would belie. Independence "
"of the OS and the Apps, with respect to updates/upgrades is a benefit to "
"stability and security.  The benefits and pitfalls can come to the forefront "
"when pushing the use case. Which currently doesn't seem to need much of a "
"push. The writing of this document is being done using Atom as a flatpak on "
"Fedora Silverblue 29. Atom comes with a plethora of plugins called packages, "
"that can be of immense use for document creation and editing.  Things like "
"linters for various writing foibles. One such is Proselint, for which there "
"is a Package in Atom. Proselint is useful to help with your writing "
"clarity.  The Proselint Package installs fine in the Atom flatpak being used "
"on Silverblue, but gives an error about not finding proselint. Of course, "
"proselint needs to be installed, and can be via rpm-ostree with the command "
"`~]$ rpm-ostree install proselint`, followed by the command `~]$ systemctl "
"reboot` to boot into the new image. Once back up and logged in, run "
"proselint in the terminal on the file with the expected results, yet Atom "
"still does not find proselint when the Proselint package tool is run. For "
"now, the Proselint Package in Atom is disabled and the solution is to use "
"the command line `~]$ proselint <filename>` to check the file in a "
"terminal.  This does point to a type of issue faced in using Fedora "
"Silverblue as a daily workstation, flatpak app and host apps interaction, "
"specifically there normally is none. Do I submit a bug to Silveblue? Atom? "
"the Proselint Atom Package support? Is it a bug in the first place, and not "
"just that my way of thinking about a workstation is in need of revision? As "
"this example has shown, the immediate solution to the problem was to use a "
"layered application in a terminal to check the file that is saved by the "
"Atom flatpak. That isn't the satisfactory one though, and it doesn't make "
"for the kind of user experience that has come to be expected."

"Through the course of using Silverblue daily, it has become apparent that an "
"orchestration of all three technologies is what occurs in fact. There are "
"times when a Container will provide the flexibility required that a Flatpak "
"cannot, Layering can sometimes be the only answer to a problem, and Flatpaks "
"in general work fine as they are intended.  This is very likely echoed "
"elsewhere throughout any community of users of an OSTree type of OS, whether "
"Silverblue or others that use libostree. To successfully navigate this "
"terrain it's good to be up on all things rpm-ostree, all things flatpak, and "
"a whole lot of things container related."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"Each of the technologies expose varying levels of access to the OS image, "
"with the Layering approach being the most intrusive in the fact it causes a "
"new image tree to be created. The Flatpak application is definitely the "
"least intrusive being sandboxed, with limited indirect access and limited "
"developer capabilities to program in access to system resources. Containers "
"have more access to system processes and devices."

"As stated on https://flatpak.org/[flatpak.org] 'Flatpak is a next-generation "
"technology for building and distributing desktop applications on "
"Linux. Flatpak uses libostree to store application data, distinct from the "
"host system management model.' In practice, what this means is that the "
"flatpak deployment of an application does not normally have access to the "
"host OS directly, or any other applications running on the host. The "
"application is running on a runtime contained inside of the flatpak "
"itself. If this sounds a lot like a flatpak is a container, it's because it "
"is a container essentially. An application in flatpak form is running inside "
"of its own environment designed specifically to make it work as intended, "
"irrespective of the host OS, and is quite effectively sandboxed. One of "
"Flatpak’s main goals is to increase the security of desktop systems by "
"isolating applications from one another. This is achieved using sandboxing "
"and means that, by default, applications that are run with Flatpak have "
"extremely limited access to the host environment. For day to day usage in "
"roles that encompass the bulk of things users generally are doing at their "
"PC Silverblue, with its immutable OS and flatpak'd applications proves to "
"function quite well. The updates are rolling along regularly just like the "
"Fedora Workstation I had become used to, and the majority of my applications "
"that are flatpak's work as they are intended to."

"When you first run Silverblue after the initial installation steps, you will "
"likely want to install some applications, and to do that no doubt you first "
"try Gnome Software, only to find nothing. Gnome Software is still there, "
"just not showing software to install since the flatpak repository (flathub) "
"is not configured for the system yet. This is due entirely to the Fedora "
"licensing scheme, since Flathub allows software with non-open source license "
"schemes to be distributed, like for instance rpmfusion-nonfree repo does in "
"the normal Workstation version of Fedora.  The user has to configure the "
"rpmfusion-nonfree repo in order to install anything from its repository. In "
"Silverblue, when installing flatpak'd applications, you have to configure "
"the repository for use first. You do this with the `flatpak remote-add` "
"command. This command takes as its first argument, the name you want to give "
"the remote, and the URL it is located at for the second argument. In the "
"case of the flathub repository, I simply named mine `flathub` and its URL is "
"https://dl.flathub.org/repo/. The command becomes `flatpak remote-add "
"flathub \"https://dl.flathub.org/repo/\"` without the quotes. It is also "
"acceptable, and easier to browse to Flathub.org and select the quick setup "
"option for Fedora, which Installs the repo via Gnome Software. Whichever way "
"you choose to do it, will result in you now having access to all of the "
"flatpak'd applications and extensions available on the Flathub repo. These "
"applications will be displayed as usual in Gnome Software with their origin "
"being dl.flathub.org. There are more applications being offered as flatpak's "
"each day it seems, so check back often if your favourite isn't listed "
"yet. There is more you can do with the repo now that you have it "
"installed. The flatpak command has numerous options that are useful for "
"inspecting what is available at a configured repo. The command `flatpak "
"remotes` will list the installed/configured repositories, and if you use the "
"`-d` switch with the command like so `flatpak remotes -d` you will get a "
"detailed listing of your configured remotes (repo's)."

"Also, it is worth noting that there are other remotes available to be "
"configured on your system if you would like to explore some more. If you "
"want to have Firefox as a flatpak, instead of using the version shipped as "
"part of the Ostree of Silverblue, you could configure the firefox nighly "
"remote (https://dl.flathub.org/repo/) with the following command `flatpak "
"remote-add firefox-nightly <https://dl.flathub.org/repo/>` then install the "
"FireFox nightly build with the command `flatpak install firefox-nightly "
"org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly` and flatpak will install the Firefox nightly "
"build for you. You may have already come to the conclusion that you could "
"also install it from Gnome Software since you have configured the remote, "
"and you would be correct but take note of the source listed on its install "
"icon, it is the remote you just configured. As no doubt. some of the clever "
"monkeys out there have likely noted when they did a remote-ls command on "
"their configured flathub remote, there are more things listed than the "
"app's. There are runtimes, and sdk's as well as app's since Flathub.org is a "
"place to distribute such things."
